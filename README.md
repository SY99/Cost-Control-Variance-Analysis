# 📊 Project Cost Control & Variance Analysis (Excel)

**Planned vs Actual Cost Tracking – Construction Project**

---

## 📌 Overview

This Excel project demonstrates a **cost control and variance analysis framework** for a residential construction project.

The objective is to analyze:
- Planned costs vs actual costs
- Cost overruns and underruns
- Task-wise and contractor-wise financial performance
- Monthly cost behavior

The project is designed to mirror **real-world project accounting and cost monitoring** used in construction, operations, and finance teams.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track planned and actual costs by task
- Identify cost overruns using variance analysis
- Provide decision-ready views for project managers
- Enable quick slicing by contractor, task, and month
- Demonstrate Excel-based financial analytics skills

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset is **simulated but operationally realistic** and contains:

| Column Name     | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Project Name    | Construction project                          |
| Task Name       | Site activity (e.g., Brick Work, Tiling)     |
| Contractor Name | Assigned contractor                          |
| Month           | Reporting month                              |
| Planned Cost    | Budgeted cost                                |
| Actual Cost     | Incurred cost                                |
| Variance        | Actual Cost – Planned Cost                   |

Costs are aggregated at task level and analyzed monthly.

## 📊 Analysis Performed

### ✅ Pivot Tables

- Planned vs Actual Cost by Task
- Total and monthly cost aggregation
- Variance calculation

### ✅ Variance Logic

- **Positive variance** → Cost overrun  
- **Negative variance** → Cost savings  

Conditional formatting highlights:
- 🔴 Overruns
- 🟢 Savings

---

## 📈 Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Planned vs Actual Cost Comparison
- Clustered bar chart
- Displays budget vs actual spend
- Values scaled to **₹ Lakhs** for readability

### 2️⃣ Variance by Task
- Dedicated variance bar chart
- Quickly identifies high-risk activities
- Supports focused cost-control decisions

---

## 🎛️ Interactivity

Slicers included for:
- Contractor Name
- Task
- Month

This allows users to dynamically explore cost behavior across dimensions.

---

## 💡 Key Insights (Example)

- Brickwork and Slab Cleaning show consistent cost overruns
- Electrical and Cleaning activities remain close to budget
- Cost overruns increase in later project months
- Certain contractors show repeated budget deviation patterns

---

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
- Calculated fields & variance analysis
- Conditional formatting for financial insights
- Slicers & interactive reporting
- Business-oriented interpretation of data

---

## ✅ Use Case Relevance

This project is relevant for:
